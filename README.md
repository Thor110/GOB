## GALLERY OF BABEL

Based on the Library of Babel concept by Jorge Luis Borges, this application is an extension of that concept.

Currently it contains a simple image generator, audio generatorm, book generator and 3D model generator.

No functionality for seeds have been implemented yet and the video generator does not currently work.

#IMPLICATIONS

I feel that the implications and potential for seed based generation of these types of media are profound.

This could allow for some really interesting possibilities such as reducing file sizes to the bare minimum.

Though it is worth noting that in some cases, filesizes are already at the bare minimum, for example text files and the only way to further reduce that is through compression algorithms.

There are a lot of other prospects that this idea raises, which I have discussed in great detail with both Llama 3.1 and others.

#INSPIRATION

I came up with this idea after discussing the concept and implications of the Library of Babel with Llama 3.1

It also generated a lot of the code used for this project, while I was going to tackle writing the code myself at first I felt that the discussions I had with it had opened up an opportunity to see how well it handled writing code.

Especially given the nature and purpose of the program.

#GAME

I am considering making a game form of this extension of the concept of the Library of Babel

With an elevator by the stairs that can be used to travel between the different Libraries / Galleries
